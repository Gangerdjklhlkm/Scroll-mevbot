day 2: wallets, "an account is just a big number you pick"

private key in eth.build, learn how to keep a mnemonic safe

setup a metamask and drop testnet/ETH to everyone to send around

custodial vs non-custodial - smart contract wallets

---

setup a metamask 

show off the 12 word seed phrase

explain that if you lose it, it's gone forever

explain how it can be recovered from the 12 words and you get a bunch of accounts (deterministic, always the same accounts)

explain difference between: 12 word seed phrase VS metamask password

"Couldn't just someone bruteforce-guess my 12 words, or any other person 12 words?" => I like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lz2if8/comment/gpzur49/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) reddit comment, laying out the chances of this happening.

use eth.build to show the relationship between menmonics, pks, public keys, and addresses

"An ethereum account is just a really big number you pick"

show them how to get testnet ETH - talk about how to get real ETH

we will send some testnet eth around

use etherscan to verify the sends 

custodial vs non-custodial

smart contract wallets

(suggestion) touch on wallet security, keep it safe. Don't use your real wallet for testing
