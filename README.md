### Week 1 - 👩‍🔬 Becoming A Power User

- **day 1**: intro %TODO% - %%% we'll come back to this and fill in whatever details we need to cover up front %%%

  discussions: Blockchains, decentralization, Unstoppable apps, money/incentives at the protocol, coordination
   
  Redundancy, Censorship resistance, web3 cron jobs are different, trust (escrow is a good way to explain)
  
  simple to code, composability, compounding pace
   
  apps: what are people building? NFT, DEFI, DAOS - disclaimer: some garbage
      
  gotchas: expensive, mnemonic lost means everything lost, chain is hard to parse, apps are centralized, so much noise

  future: building coordination games for nation states - funding public goods - radical markets?

  but if we have time to explain things slowly over many episodes...

### Next Steps!

**Success tier 1:** Get hired as a junior with your Speed Run portfolio... build things and show them off on twitter!  ([Here](https://twitter.com/austingriffith/status/1478760479275175940?s=20&t=0zGF8M_7Hoeuy-D6LDoFpA) is a good "next steps" thread)

**Success tier 2:** Build your own product or start building forkable examples and tutorials for the ecosystem 
(Go learn something and then leave the camp site better than you found it. Help the next dev learn what you learned, but easier.) 

**Success tier 3:** Go crush some of the harder challenges like the [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/), read through previous audits, start auditing yolos from the BG, get introduced to audit firms and folks within our network that are at the cutting edge with solidity auditing...
