### Week 1 - 👩‍🔬 Becoming A Power User

The first step to starting as a developer in the web3 ecosystem is first to become a Power User!

You should start by getting hands-on & using the tools which will give you a much greater understanding of what you can do and what the crypto space is all about. In this section, we're talking about the tools in the crypto space, using them and helping you become an Ethereum power user.

### Week 2 - 👩‍🚀 Scripting, Smart Contracts / Solidity 

In this section we'll **start programming!** 

It goes from writing scripts to talk to the blockchain to building Decentrazlized Applications(dApps). The topics covered included Providers, Signers, ethers.js, hardhat, scaffold-eth and many more! Follow the notes [here.](https://github.com/austintgriffith/web2-to-web3-curriculum/blob/main/week1/week-1-notes.md)

### Week 3 - 🧙‍♀️ Building Dapps - SpeedRunEthereum.com

In this section, we'll be going through **SpeedRunEthereum!** 

SpeedRunEthereum is a set of challenges for developers to get building with Ethereum. It's not only about learning the syntax but also understanding what's possible with Ethereum. It's also a great way to build your web3 portfolio. You'll be writing code and deploying your smart contracts.

### Week 4 - 🚢  Build Your Own Project 

Now its your turn to **create your own project!** 

It's all about building forkable components with Scaffold-ETH. You can make a new voting system component, work on the open issues, make a new challenge for SpeedRunEthereum, etc. Just make sure to have a well written README so that anyone can easily set it up. Create your project & upload it to your BuidlGuidl Profile! 

There's a lot you can build and you can collaborate with other builders in the ecosystem! That's where BuildGuild comes in! BuidlGuidl is a group of builders that build tools with Scaffold-ETH, meet and learn together, and get funded for contributing. The goal is to empower builders for creating prototypes, projects and resources for the Ethereum ecosystem. 🌟 After building forkable Scaffold-ETH components, submitting them to your builder profile, and being active in the BuidlGuidl Telegram groups, you can get the opportunity to join BuidlGuidl!

### Next Steps!

**Congrats!!** Now its time to move to the next stages! There are many different pathways to continue with the skills you've gained through the weeks. Here are some options:

- **Start Working in a web3 company:** Get hired as a junior with your Speed Run portfolio. Build things and show them off on Twitter!  ([Here](https://twitter.com/austingriffith/status/1478760479275175940?s=20&t=0zGF8M_7Hoeuy-D6LDoFpA) is a great "next steps" thread)

- **Build your own tools:** Build your own product or start building forkable examples and tutorials for the ecosystem 
(Go learn something and then leave the camp site better than you found it. Help the next dev learn what you learned, but easier.) 

- **Continue learning more advanced concepts:** Go crush some of the harder challenges like the [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/), read through previous audits, start auditing yolos from the BG, get introduced to audit firms and folks within our network that are at the cutting edge with solidity auditing...
