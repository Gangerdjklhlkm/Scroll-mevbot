day 4: NFT day! Buy and trade NFTS, maybe use an NFT to token gate a chat? POAPs!

IPFS and offchain storage - maybe graph?

SVG NFTs!

Mint an NFT - learn whats minting

---

What's an NFT?
- Fungible vs Non-fungible
- Brief mention of ERC721 & ERC1155
- use cases: token gate, collectibles, etc.

Explain what's IPFS

Opensea and NFTs markets

We can show the Loogies (SVG) & Sanford Stout (IPFS) NFT examples.

What's is minting? What actually happens when sending over tokens? => Just state changes in the contract.

We could talk about how any of us could deploy any NFT exactly like another one and how on-chain provenance is how the market selects NFTs.  

We could tinker around with nifty.ink ? I think it's still setup so we can do token gating with collabland 

We should talk about Loot and composability. 

Letting creators/artists interact directly with their audience. 

Mint a loogie or sanford stout NFT.
  - Check the TX
  - Show it on opensea
