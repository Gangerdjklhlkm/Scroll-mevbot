**week 2 / day 2:** Contract interation with EthersJS

Day 1 recap (+ create some utils.js):
- getProvider()
- generateNewWallet()
- getSigner()

Use these utils to send some rinkeby ETH (sendTransaction)

Instantiating a (remote) contract in Ethers. We'll use Sandford's NFT contract as an example

What's an ABI (grab it from etherscan)

Read value from a contract

Send a tx to a contract (mint)

Explain a bit about calldata => craft a raw tx with calldata

---

Extra: In the same script, mint some [rinkeby DAI](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x8ad3aa5d5ff084307d28c8f514d7a193b2bfe725), send rinkeby, approve someone to withdraw my rinkeby DAI.
