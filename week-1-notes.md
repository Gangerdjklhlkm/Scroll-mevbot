## Day 2: Wallets

#### Crypto Wallets

A **crypto wallet** is what allows you to talk to the blockchain network. It gives you the tools you need to interact with cryptocurrencies. Examples of cryptocurrency wallets are Metamask, Ledger, Rainbow.

A crypto wallet generates a private key and a public key. The main functionality of a crypto wallet is to store your keys and sign transactions. 

-	A public key, as the name indicates is public. If you give your public address or associated crypto addresses, then people can send you cryptocurrencies. 
-	üîê A private key is like your password. You should keep it safe and never share it with anyone. Anyone with your private key has full access to your wallet. 
Its just 256 digit binary number. It‚Äôs hard to remember and store this number, thats where seed pharses come in. 

A mnemonic (also known as a seed phrase) is a way to restore your private key. It's is a 12-word combination which can be used generate private keys. 
Seed phrases creates a convienet way to save to restore your crypto wallet. 

Note: do not share your seed phrase or private key with anyone! Whomever has access to these, has full access to your account.

Types of crypto wallets: **Custodial Wallets vs Non-Custodial Wallets**

-	Custodial Wallets: A third-party (generally an exchange such as Coinbase, Binance, Robinhood) has your private keys and signs transactions on your behalf. You trust the third party to hold the keys for you.
-	Non-Custodial Wallets: The user owns the private keys of the non-custodial wallet. Unlike a custodial wallet, there is no third party in between. Therefore, the user is the only person that has the private key and/or seed phrase. There is no customer servie for non- custodial wallets and no one should ask you seed phrase or private keys. 

#### Transactions 

Everything you do on ethereum is a transaction. For example, 
when you send some tokens from one account to another it will be addded to the ledger as a transaction. 
[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is a block explorer for Etherum which records all the transactions to display them in a easy way. 

**Gas Fees** 

Every transaction on the blockchain has a cost. So when you want to send tokens you need to pay the price called **gas fee**. Gas is the measure of the unit to denote the cost for a transaction. Accordingly, gas fees are the fees that are paid to the network to process the transactions. 
On Ethereum, gas fees are paid in ETH and denoted in gwei.
