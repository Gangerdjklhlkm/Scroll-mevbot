plan / notes

day 3: Get an ENS (talk about identity), swap to a stable coin (talk about DEXs and stables)

"everything is a transaction" even when you talk to a smart contract

good chance to talk about gas and the mempool and even a sandwich attack on our swap

notice how your ENS follows you to Uniswap and you can see your stables in zapper

where is identity going? DIDs/cermaic/Lens

---

What is ENS? (talk about similarities with DNS)

Explain how to buy one

Show ENS admin panel: Reverse records, registar / controller

DEX vs CEX

What are stable coins? / Use cases / Pegging mechanisms

What are smart contracts? (We only talked about smart contracts (wallets) a bit on day 2)

Swap some ETH to stable on Uniswap.
 - Just a smart contract that handle the prices with a "simple" formula
 - ENS follows you to Uniswap
 - gas / mempools / slippage / sandwich attack

It's easy to create identities (can be just an ETH address) => Sybil attack
