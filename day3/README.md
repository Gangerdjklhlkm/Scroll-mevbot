day 3: interact with a few Ethereum services...

What are smart contracts? (We only talked about smart contracts (wallets) a bit on day 2)

Some of the most famous smart contracts are just tokens ERC20 and ERC721 you just send them around (but the smart contract is keeping track of how much you have) 

"everything is a transaction" even when you talk to a smart contract

Gas?

Get an ENS (talk about identity), swap to a stable coin (talk about DEXs and stables)

good chance to talk about gas and the mempool and even a sandwich attack on our swap

notice how your ENS follows you to Uniswap and you can see your stables in zapper

where is identity going? DIDs/cermaic/Lens
(identity is about local context not some universal, top down identification system)

What is ENS? (talk about similarities with DNS)

Explain how to buy one

Show ENS admin panel: Reverse records, registar / controller

DEX vs CEX

What are stable coins? / Use cases / Pegging mechanisms


Swap some ETH to stable on Uniswap.
 - Just a smart contract that handle the prices with a "simple" formula
 - ENS follows you to Uniswap
 - gas / mempools / slippage / sandwich attack

It's easy to create identities (can be just an ETH address) => Sybil attack
