plan / notes 

--
day 5: Defi, DAOs, multsigs, wallet connect

Transactions: cancel & speed up transaction (change gas fees on metamask)

(should we warn about the reset thing and talk about nonce/chainid issues?)

L2: bridge tokens (what is bridge & how to send assets - use the polygon bridge) 

Staking tokens 

flashloans - atomic transactions

Multisig: setup a gnosis safe, sign transactions 

DAOs: what are DAOs, where to find & join 

We could take out a loan and generate DAI with overcollateralized ETH
